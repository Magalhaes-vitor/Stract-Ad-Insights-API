# Stract-Ad-Insights-API
 This repository contains the implementation of a local server in Python (Flask) to consume data from an imaginary Stract client advertising API. The server provides real-time reports in CSV format, pulling data from ad platforms, accounts, and campaign insights. Through specific endpoints, the system organizes data in a tabular and aggregated form, allowing access to detailed or summarized reports for each advertising platform. The code was developed with a focus on simplicity and efficiency, using minimal dependencies.
